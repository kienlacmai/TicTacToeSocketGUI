# TicTacToeSocketGUI
The following files can be interactive on both separate or single machine/s. Each program is to be executed individually excluding the gameboard.py module.
An interactive, simple Tic Tac Toe Game is created utilizing a socket connection and the Tkinter Python library serving as the GUI.
This project serves as one of the first projects of my SW Development journey.
